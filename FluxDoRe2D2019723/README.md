# FluxDoRe2D
Flux Integration by Donating Regions in 2D

## Algorithm
This code implements theoretical results developed by Daniel Karrasch,
inspired by prior work by Qinghai Zhang. Most of the code has been 
written by Florian Hofherr in the course of his BSc work under the
supervision of Daniel Karrasch. See the documents for more information.

## Installation
Tested on Matlab R2017a.

Installation notes :

1. After you unzipped the files to mydir, put the Current Directory in Matlab to mydir.

2. In the Matlab command prompt, type "add_path" to add the necessary folders to the top of the search path.

3. You can now try any of the examples.

## Citation
Please cite [1] and [2] if you use the code in your own work.
